A Hybrid Decentralized Exchange 


It combines features of both centralized and decentralized architectures in order to exploit the best of both worlds: strong authentication, simplicity, lightning fast, future developmental proof capability, as well as transparency and fairness.

 

HexBean is much faster than any existing cryptoexchange. 70,000 TRX/Sec is achievable. 


HexBeanExchange incorporates a decentralized ledger within its proprietary centralized platform in order to neutralize front-running and guarantee the un-alterability, temporality, and transparency of the order book. 

 

HexBean Exchangeâ€™s unique hybrid model and strategic partnerships provide a fair and secure trading environment in which every type of transaction, intra-chain, cross-chain, and crypto/fiat, is executable. 

 

Thus, unlike fully decentralized exchanges, HexBean can cover 100% market share with full transparency and security.
